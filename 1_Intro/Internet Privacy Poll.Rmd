Problem 1.1 - Loading and Summarizing the Dataset
0 points possible (ungraded)
Using read.csv(), load the dataset from AnonymityPoll.csv into a data
frame called poll and summarize it with the summary() and str()
functions.
How many people participated in the poll?
```{r}
require(dplyr)
require(tidyr)
df <- read.csv('1_Intro/AnonymityPoll.csv')
nrow(df)
```
Problem 1.2 - Loading and Summarizing the Dataset
0 points possible (ungraded)
Let's look at the breakdown of the number of people with smartphones
using the table() and summary() commands on the Smartphone variable.
(HINT: These three numbers should sum to 1002.)
How many interviewees responded that they use a smartphone?
How many interviewees responded that they don't use a smartphone?
How many interviewees did not respond to the question, resulting in a
missing value, or NA, in the summary() output?
```{r}
df_dp = tbl_df(df)
groupy <- df_dp %>% group_by(Smartphone) %>%  tally() %>% spread(Smartphone,n,fill=0)
class(groupy)
View(groupy)
```
**Problem 1.3 - Loading and Summarizing the Dataset**
By using the table() function on two variables, we can tell how they are
related. To use the table() function on two variables, just put the two
variable names inside the parentheses, separated by a comma (don't
forget to add poll$ before each variable name). In the output, the
possible values of the first variable will be listed in the left, and the
possible values of the second variable will be listed on the top. Each
entry of the table counts the number of observations in the data set that
have the value of the first value in that row, and the value of the second
variable in that column. For example, suppose we want to create a table
of the variables "Sex" and "Region". We would type
table(poll$Sex, poll$Region)
in our R Console, and we would get as output
Midwest Northeast South West
Female 123 90 176 116
Male 116 76 183 122
This table tells us that we have 123 people in our dataset who are
female and from the Midwest, 116 people in our dataset who are male
and from the Midwest, 90 people in our dataset who are female and
from the Northeast, etc.
You might find it helpful to use the table() function to answer the
following questions:
Which of the following are states in the Midwest census region? (Select
all that apply.)
```{r}
groupo <- df_dp %>% group_by(Region)  %>% count(State) %>% spread(Region,n,fill='X')
View(groupo)

```
