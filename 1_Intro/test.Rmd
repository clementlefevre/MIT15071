df_Boeing = read.csv('BoeingStock.csv')
df_Coca = read.csv('CocaColaStock.csv')
df_Procter = read.csv('ProcterGambleStock.csv')
df_GE = read.csv('GEStock.csv')
df_IBM = read.csv('IBMStock.csv')
dfos <- list(Boeing=df_Boeing,Coca=df_Coca,Procter = df_Procter,GE = df_GE,IBM =df_IBM)


for (namo in names(dfos)){
  print (namo)
  #dfos[[namo]]$Date = as.Date(strptime(dfos[[namo]]$Date,"%d/%m/%y"))
  head(dfos[[namo]])
}
dfos$Boeing
```
