El classico : compute mean on columns and getting an **NA**

```{r}
mean(df$Internet.Use)
```
ADD na.rm=TRUE
```{r}
mean(df$Info.On.Internet,na.rm = TRUE)
```


Get the number of na per columns
```{r}
df%>% summarise_each(funs(sum(is.na(.)))) %>% gather()
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
